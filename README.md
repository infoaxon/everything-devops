This is the README file for the Everything related to DevOps. DevOps is one of my favourite topics to learn around and implement. We do it for our internal needs and look for continuous improvements in DevOps. 

This is where we learn following topics:

# Main Components

#  GIT and also keep the GIT tricks and other related configs very handy and will be used for learning GIT better
